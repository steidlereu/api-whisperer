# API Journeys for a Coffee Shop API

A **Coffee Shop API** facilitates various user interactions and business operations. These API journeys outline how different stakeholdersâ€”customers, baristas, and managersâ€”engage with the system.

## 1. Customer Journey: From Ordering to Pickup

A customer begins their journey by logging into the coffee shop app. If they are a new user, they register an account, which generates a unique user ID and authentication token. Once logged in, they browse the menu, selecting their preferred coffee and pastries. The API retrieves real-time menu data, ensuring availability and displaying options for customization, such as choosing between oat milk, almond milk, or extra espresso shots.

After selecting items, the customer proceeds to checkout. They confirm the order, apply any available discounts or loyalty points, and choose a payment method. The API processes the transaction securely and generates an order confirmation. The system then assigns a preparation time, and the order status updates from **pending** to **in progress**.

As baristas begin preparing the order, the customer receives real-time updates through API polling or WebSocket notifications. When the order is ready, the status changes to **ready for pickup**, and the customer gets notified. They pick up their coffee, and the order is marked as **completed**. A digital receipt is sent via email, and loyalty points are added to their account for future use.

## 2. Barista Journey: Managing Orders Efficiently

The barista starts their shift by logging into the system, which authenticates their role and grants access to the order management dashboard. New orders appear in the **pending** queue, each showing details such as customer preferences and payment status.

As the barista prepares each order, they update its status to **in progress** through the API, triggering a customer notification. Once the order is completed, they update the status to **ready for pickup**, ensuring smooth communication between staff and customers. The barista can also handle modifications, such as order cancellations or changes if the customer requests an adjustment.

At the end of their shift, baristas log out, and the system records their completed orders, helping managers track employee efficiency and order fulfillment rates.

## 3. Manager Journey: Overseeing Operations

The manager logs into the system with administrative privileges, gaining access to menu management, inventory tracking, and sales analytics. They can add or remove items from the menu, update pricing, and introduce seasonal promotions using the API.

To maintain smooth operations, the manager monitors inventory levels. The API tracks stock levels in real-time, alerting the manager when supplies are low. If a critical ingredient like coffee beans is running low, the system can automatically trigger a reorder from the supplier.

Using business insights from the analytics API, the manager reviews peak hours, top-selling items, and customer trends. These insights help them optimize staffing schedules and marketing strategies. They can also track customer reviews and feedback to improve service quality.

At the end of the day, the manager generates a report summarizing sales, inventory usage, and customer engagement, ensuring data-driven decision-making.

## 4. Supplier Journey: Restocking the Coffee Shop

Suppliers interact with the API when the system detects low stock and sends an automated **reorder request**. The supplier receives details about the required inventory, such as the type and quantity of coffee beans or milk cartons needed. They confirm fulfillment via an API response, updating the estimated delivery time.

Upon delivery, the system updates inventory levels, marking the order as **received** and ensuring the coffee shop is always stocked with essential supplies.

## 5. Loyalty Program Journey: Rewarding Customers

The loyalty program API tracks customer purchases, awarding points for each transaction. Customers can view their loyalty balance and redeem rewards when placing new orders. If they choose to apply their points at checkout, the API calculates the discount and deducts the corresponding amount from their total.

Managers can introduce special promotions, such as double reward points on specific products, through the API. Customers receive notifications about these offers, encouraging repeat business and fostering brand loyalty.

## Conclusion

These API journeys demonstrate how a coffee shop API seamlessly connects customers, baristas, managers, and suppliers. From placing an order to managing inventory and tracking loyalty rewards, API integration ensures efficient operations, enhances customer satisfaction, and enables data-driven decision-making. ðŸš€â˜•
